Iterative statement:-

If we want to excute a group of statement multiple times then we should go for iterative statements.

Python supports 2 types of iterative statements.

1.for loop
2.while loop


for loop:-

if we want to excute some action for element present in some sequence(like list,set etc)then we should go for for loop.


syntax:-

for x in sequence:
	body

where sequence can be string or any collection.body will be executed for every element present in the sequnec.

s = 'subhankar lenka'

for i in s:
    print(i)

output:-

s
u
b
h
a
n
k
a
r
 
l
e
n
k
a



range:- it's returns the value as sequence wise.

'''for i in range(10):
    print(i)'''

for i in range(21):
    if(i%2!=0):
        print(i)

dictionary:=

d = {'name':'kusha','age':23,'passout':2021}

for k,v in d.items():
    print(k,'=',v)

 output:-

name = kusha
age = 23
passout = 2021


#To print sum of numbers present inside list.

li = eval(input('Enter your list:'))

sum = 0

for i in li:
    sum = sum + i
print(sum)


1.WAP to print hello 10 times.
2.To display even number from 0 to 10
3.To display numbers from 10 to 1 descending order

                       Functions
                       ---------

If a group of statememnt is repeatedly required then it is not recommended to write these statements evevrytime seperatly.We have to define these statement as a single unit and we can call that unit any number of times based on our requirement without rewriting.This unit is nothing but function.

Adv:- The main advantage of functions is code reusability.

python supports 2 types of functions

1.in-built/Bulit in functions.
2.user define function.

in-built/Bulit in:-
------------------

The functions which are coming along with python software automatically,are called built in functions or pre-define function.

ex:-

print()
input()
id()
type()
eval()
sum()
len()


user define function.:-
------------------------

The functions which are developed by programmer explicitly according to business requirement are called user define functions.

syntax to create user define func.
---------------------------------

def func_name(snake casing)():
	'''doc'''
	bussiness logic


Note:- While creating functions we can use 2 keywords

1.def(mandatory)
2.return(optional)


ex:- Write a function to print hello.


def wish():
    print('Hello Good morning')

wish()

output:-Hello Good morning



Parameter:- Paarameter are inputs to the function contains parameters,then at the time of calling,compulsory we should provide values otherwise,we will get error.


#Ex:- Write a function take name of the student.
def add(a,b):
	print(a+b)


add(10,20)
add(657,890)
add(675,343)
add(786,900)

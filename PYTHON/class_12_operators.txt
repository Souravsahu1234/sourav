                        Operators
                        ---------

operator is a symbol that perform certain operation.
python provides the following set of operator.

1. Arithmetic Operator.
2. Relational or comparision Operator.
3. Logical Operator.
4. Bitwise Operator.
5. Assignment Operator.
6. Special Operator.


Arithmetic Operator:-

which Operator is performing mathmetical operations that is callde Arithmetic Operator.

+ ---> Addition
- --->substraction
* --->multiplication
/ --->division
% --->modulo
// --> Floor division
** --> exponent or power

ex:=

>>> b = 25
>>> 
>>> a + b
75
>>> a - b
25
>>> a * b
1250
>>> a/b
2.0
>>> a % b
0
>>> a // b
2
>>> 3 ** 2
9
>>> 3 ** 4
81
>>> 


string:- In the arithmetic operation there are 2 operator are use in string data type also.

addition:-

>>> 'AB' + 'CD'
'ABCD'
>>> 

multiplication:-

>>> 'AB' * 3
'ABABAB'
>>> 

Relational or comparision Operator:-

which is given relation between two numbers or variables,that is called Relational operator and result is given the boolean form(True/False).

>,>=,<,<=,==,!=

>>> a = 10
>>> b = 20
>>> 
>>> a > b
False
>>> a >= b
False
>>> a < b
True
>>> a <= b
True
>>> a == b
False
>>> a != b
True
>>> 

3.Logical Operator:-

and , or , not

we can apply for all types.

Note:- It's returns the boolean value.

For boolean types behaviour:-

and:- If both arguments are True then only result is True otherwise False.

T and T = T
T and F = F
F and F = F

or:- If atleast one argument is True the result is True otherwise False.

T or T = T
T or F = T
F or F = F

not:- complement

>>> not True
False
>>> not False
True
>>> 

For non-boolean types behaviour:-
--------------------------------

0 means False
non-zero means True
empty string,list,tuple,set,fzset,bytes,bytearry,dictiuonary all are False.

4.Bitwise operator:-

we can apply these operator bitwise.
These operator are applicable only for int and boolean types.

& --- and
| --- or
^ --- Xor
~ --- Not
<< --- B-Right
>> ----B-Left

Assingnment Operators:-
----------------------

We can use assignment operator to assign same component of value to the variable.

ex:-
x = 10

compound assignment:-

we can combine asignment operator with some other operator to form compound assignmemnt operator.

>>> x = 10
>>> x = x + 10
>>> 
>>> a = 20
>>> 
>>> a+=10----------------compound assignment.
>>> a = a+ 10

+= ---- 
-=
*=
/=
//=
**=
%=

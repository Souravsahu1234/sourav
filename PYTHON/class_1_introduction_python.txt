                         Programming Lang.

Low Level Programming lang:- 
it's only user binary numbers and here only 0 and 1 is applicable. so that programming speed is very slow but outpu is very very fast.

ex: a:-01100001

Middle level programming lang:-
 First time keyboard was introduced and here a converter is applicable the main moto of converter is convert english to binary format. For using the conerter the programming is fast but output is very slow.

High Level Programming lang:-

Oop's(object oriented programming) and Pop's(Procedure oriented programming):- scripting lang) is introduced in the high level programming lang.programming speed is very fast.nad out is very fast.

              Language and Fundamental:-

1.Python is a general purpose of 'High Level Programming Language.'
2.python is scripting lang.
3.Python was developed by 'Guido Van Rossam' in 1989 while working at 
  National Reserach Institute at Netherland.
4.But officially Python was made available to public in 1991.The official  DOB for pythopn is:Feb 20th 1991.

c:
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
	print("hello world")
}

python:-
print("Hello world")


Where we can use python:-

we can use everywhere. The most common important application areas are.

1.For Developing Desktop application.
2.For Developing web application.
3.For Developing Database application.
4.For Network Programming.
5.For developing games.
6.For Data Analysis application.
7.For Machine Learning.
8.For AI(Artificial Intelligence) application.
9.For IOT(Internet of things).


Note:- Internally Google and Youtube use python coding.

Chapter_2            Identifiers

A name in python program is called identifier.

It can be class name or function name or variable name or module name.

Rules to Define Indetifiers in Python:-
--------------------------------------
Note:- Python is case sensitive.

1.The only allowed charcter python are:-

-->alphabet symbols(either lower case or upper case)
-->digits(0 to 9)
-->only underscore sumbol(_)

2.Indentifier should not start with digit.

---> 12total = 10----(wrong)
---> total12 = 10----(correct)
---> _12 = 10----(correct)

3.Indentifires are case sesitive,of course python lang is case sensitive lang. so that indifiers also case sensitive

----> total = 10
---->TOTAL = 99

4.There are 2 types of nameing.
---> Camel casing
---> Snake casing

Camel casing:- ---every words starting char. is capital and here is no space and no (_) is using

ex:-TheBankingProject , MobileApplicationTerm

Snake casing:- every words are small leter,and here is used(_) symbol but no space are allowed.

ex:- _the_banking_project , mobile_application_term


Note:-
1.Id identifiers start with _ symbol then it is indicate smoethingelse.

 x = 10 -----normal varaibale
 _x = 10 -----protected variable
__x = 10-----private variable
___x = 10----magic variable

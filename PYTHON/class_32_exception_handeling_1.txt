                    Exception Handeling
                    -------------------

In programming language there are 2 types of errors are possiable.

1.Syntax Errors
2.Runtime Errors/User define Errors.

Syntax Errors:-
--------------

The errors which occurs because of invalid syntax are called syntax errors.

ex:-

for i in range(1,10)
	print(i)

SyntaxError : invalid syntax

ex:-

print'Hello'

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Note:- Programmer is responsiable to correct these syntax errors,once all syntax are corected then only program execution will be started.

2.Runtime Errors:-
------------------

Also know as Exceptions.
While executing the program if something goes wrong coz of end user input or programming logic or memory problem etc then we will ger Runtime Errors.

ex:-1
 10/0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#1>", line 1, in <module>
    10/0
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

ex:-2

print(10/'ten')
output:-
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'int' and 'str'

ex:-3

x = int(input('Enter the first number:'))

output:-

Enter the first number:Subhankar
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\chand\PycharmProjects\python_ITM#!_project\Exception Handeling\exception_handel.py", line 3, in <module>
    x = int(input('Enter the first number:'))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Subhankar'


Note:- Exception handeling concept applicable only for Runtime Errors but not for syntax errors.

What is Exception:-
------------------

An unwanted and unexcepted event that distrubs normal flow of programs is called exception.

ex:-

ZeroDivisonError
ValueError
TypeError
FileNotFoundError
EOFError

It is highly recommended to handel exceptions.the main objective of expetion handeling is Graceful Termination of the program.

Exception handeling does not mean repairinh exception.we have to define althernetive way to continue rest of the program normally.

ex:-

try:
	Ricky Code

except ErrorName:
	
	error slove


1.What is Exception?
2.What is the purpose of exception handeling?
3.What is the meaning of exception handeling


            

                       Python's Exception Hierarchy
Imp Error:-

1.AttributeError
2.ArithmeticError
3.ZeroDivisionError
4.OSError
5.FileNotFoundError
6.Exception

Every Exception in Python is a class.

All exceptions classes are child classes of BaseException.That is very exception class extends BaseException either directly or indirectly..Henece BaseException acts as root for python Exception Hierarchy.

ex:-

print('subhankar')
x = eval(input('First Number:'))
y = eval(input('second Number:'))

try:
    print(x/y)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print('Zero is not allowed')
print('swayam')

output:-

subhankar
First Number:10
second Number:0
Zero is not allowed
swayam

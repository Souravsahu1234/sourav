special operator:-
----------------

python defines 2 special operators

1.Identity operators
2.Membership Operators


Identity operators:-
-------------------

we can use identity operators for adress comparision.

Note:- python have a in-built function id () for seraching the adrees / location.

2 identity operators are available

1. is
2. is not

r1 is r2 returns True if r1 and r2 are pointing to the same object.
r1 is not r2 returns True if r1 and r2 are not pointing to the same object.

ex:-1
>>> a = 10
>>> b = 10
>>> print(a is b)
True

ex:-2

>>> a = 10
>>> b = 20
>>> print(a is b)
False

ex:-3

>>> a = 10
>>> b = 20
>>> print(a is not b)
True
>>> 


Membership Operators:-(imp)

We can use membership operators to check whether the given object present in the given collection.(it may be string,list,set,tuple,fzset,bytes,bytearry,dictionary).

in  :-Returns True if the given object present in the specified 			collections.

not in:- Returns True if the given object not present in specified 				collections

>>> a = 'chiku'
>>> print('c' in a)
True
>>> print('d' in a)
False
>>> 
>>> l = [10,20,30,40]
>>> print(20 in l)
True
>>> print(200 in l)
False
>>> 


not in:-

>>> l = [10,20,30,40]
>>> print(20 not in l)
False
>>> print(70 not in l)
True
>>>
